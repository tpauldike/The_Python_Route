# The Python Route

**The Python Route** is a daily [**CodeTrybe**](https://github.com/codetrybe) Peer Learning Series,
led by [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), where peers learned `python` from the scratch and progressed from simple to complex concepts.

This repository holds some of the codes or programs that were written in the live learning sessions.
##### You can join us on Google meet everyday at *11:00 AM **GMT*** [here](http://meet.google.com/gnd-zmnh-zyd) (except on Sundays).
